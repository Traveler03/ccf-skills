At two in the morning, the experiment finally finishes. The new result is better than expected, yet reopening the manuscript reveals the harder problem. The sharp question that began the project is buried beneath related work. The method section no longer quite matches the mechanism in the code. A new experiment answers the previous review, but pulls the argument in another direction. Every part seems to have improved, while the paper as a whole has become less clear.

Many promising projects are weakened not by a poor idea, but by what happens to that idea over time. Literature accumulates, result tables expand, and the author repeatedly switches between researcher, writer, and reviewer. The original insight gradually disappears beneath local revisions. One long prompt cannot reliably preserve all these relationships because retrieval must remain faithful to sources, experiments to protocols, writing to the argument, and review to independent judgment.

CCFA Skills grew from this problem. We treat a paper as a research storyline that must remain coherent while it changes, not as a document waiting to be filled. Nineteen specialized skills accompany the work from paper reading and full translation through idea, literature, experiments, writing, visualization, review, rebuttal, and submission. As the work passes between them, the link between question, evidence, and conclusion remains intact, so the paper can evolve without forgetting why it deserved to be written.

## Quick start

Choose the agent you use:

[Codex](docs/getting-started/CODEX.md) · [Claude Code](docs/getting-started/CLAUDE_CODE.md) · [Cursor](docs/getting-started/CURSOR.md) · [Gemini CLI](docs/getting-started/GEMINI_CLI.md) · [Other agents](docs/getting-started/OTHER_AGENTS.md) · [Automatic updates](docs/getting-started/AUTO_UPDATE.md)

One-line installation for Codex:

```powershell
npx skills add Traveler03/ccf-skills --global --agent codex --skill '*' --yes --copy
```

Then describe the research problem in ordinary language:

```text
Review and rank these three ideas, and identify the most likely rejection reason for each.
Find recent work, benchmarks, and published baselines for temporal visual reasoning.
Design the main experiments, ablations, and robustness evidence for this paper without inventing results.
Rewrite the method section in a CVPR style while preserving equations, terminology, and citations.
Draw the method architecture, create an aesthetic draft first, and then ask whether to rebuild it as PPTX.
```

## Why a family of skills

The difficulties of paper research are connected, but they do not require the same kind of reasoning.

| What researchers encounter | How CCFA Skills responds |
|---|---|
| Retrieval, experiments, writing, and review compete inside one conversation | The skill best suited to the current question leads; adjacent capabilities join only when useful |
| Literature facts, experimental values, and manuscript claims drift apart | Sources, experiment design, and whole-paper consistency remain distinct responsibilities |
| A revision begins to sound like a review response full of caveats and internal status language | Writing forms the argument; Humanization restores direct and natural academic prose |
| Each review round changes its focus, obscuring whether the manuscript actually improved | Current publication readiness and progress over the previous version are considered separately |
| Architecture figures are either plain box diagrams or attractive but impossible to edit | A content-aware visual draft comes first, followed by optional SVG, PDF, or PPTX reconstruction |
| More installed skills create more noise instead of better work | Only capabilities relevant to the present question enter the conversation |

## What we value

- **The research question comes before the tool.** Judging an idea is different from developing it. Designing evidence is different from drawing a figure. Each step remains centered on the question it must answer.
- **Evidence keeps its provenance.** Literature, protocols, values, claims, figures, and citations do not collapse into plausible prose. A missing fact stays missing until it is found or verified.
- **A paper should sound academic, not defensive.** Humanization removes ritual caveats, mechanical enumeration, excessive em dashes, and internal process language while preserving material limitations and disclosures.
- **Review remains independent from revision.** The Reviewer judges; the Writer revises. Diagnosis comes before repair, so the manuscript does not argue with its own evaluation.
- **Scientific figures should explain and invite attention.** Quantitative plots remain reproducible. Method figures first explore a visual language suited to their content, then become editable when the user chooses.
- **Exemplars provide direction rather than a template.** When users supply target papers, CCFA learns their narrative rhythm, paragraph roles, and evidence organization without copying sentences or forcing one style onto every project.

## The family

![CCFA Skills family architecture](assets/ccfa-skills-architecture.svg)

Each request is led by the skill whose judgment it needs most. Other skills do not compete for the same task; they contribute only when the work reaches their domain. For example, `ccf-paper-writer` shapes the prose while `ccf-humanization` keeps its voice natural. `ccf-experiment-designer` decides what a result table must demonstrate, and `ccf-visual-composer` turns that information into a readable figure.

### The 19 core skills

|---|---|---|
| Family coordination | `ccf-common` | Understands requests, coordinates responsibilities, and protects evidence and privacy boundaries |
| Project direction | `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator` | Clarifies goals, stages, decisive milestones, and the next move |
| Project beginning | `ccf-project-scaffolder` | Prepares the paper workspace, templates, and research-material structure |

## From idea to submission

![Default research journey](assets/ccfa-skills-workflow.svg)

This is not a pipeline that everyone must enter at the beginning. You may arrive with a half-formed idea, a result table that resists interpretation, a method reviewers repeatedly misunderstand, or a PDF that is nearly ready to submit. CCFA Skills begins where you are and brings in only the help that matters there.

## Visual examples

These are research visuals rather than release-announcement graphics. Each figure uses a visual language suited to its reading context.

### Paper method architecture

The figure below extracts the computational relationships from `output/DynTrace.pdf` and draws on the treatment of hierarchy, density, and mechanism in LLaVA-4D Figure 2. Inputs and visual processing sit at the bottom, geometry-grounded evidence and the DTV/DTG branches form the middle, and token integration, the MLLM, and the answer appear at the top. We borrow a way of explaining mechanisms, not the source model or its exact composition.

![Paper method architecture](assets/visual-showcase/dyntrace-paper-mechanism-llava4d-reference.png)

**How it was made:** The DynTrace paper was distilled into mechanism relationships and representation–operation pairs. The composition language of LLaVA-4D Figure 2 then guided a GPT Image 2 draft, followed by a check that the method remained complete. The displayed artifact is a PNG visual draft; after composition approval, it can be rebuilt as semantic SVG, vector PDF, or native-object PPTX.

- A paper figure should make its inputs, representations, operations, branches, integration, and output easy to follow.
- Video frames, optical flow, masks, 3D trajectories, DT-Tokens, and the temporal graph carry method meaning rather than decoration.
- Ordinary English uses natural capitalization; Qwen3-VL, WAFT, SAM3, DTV, DTG, MLLM, 3D, and 4D retain their canonical forms.

### PPT/Poster

The two earlier visual explorations remain below. They are better suited to slides, project posters, and README overviews, so they are not presented as top-conference method figures.

#### GPT Image 2 concept draft

![GPT Image 2 concept draft](assets/visual-showcase/dyntrace-method-architecture-gpt-image-2.png)

**How it was made:** The three-stage DynTrace method was translated into a vivid visual story built around video, trajectories, and graph structure, then explored with GPT Image 2.

#### Reference-guided PPT/Poster

![Reference-guided PPT/Poster](assets/visual-showcase/dyntrace-ppt-poster-reference-driven.png)

**How it was made:** Reference composition principles were added to the three-stage content so that headings, color fields, and visual anchors would read naturally in a presentation or poster.

### Data-analysis figures

The following figures come from reproducible `ccf-visual-composer` drawing recipes. Their values demonstrate visual forms and are not reported paper findings.

| Composite figure | Heatmap |
|---|---|
| ![Composite figure](assets/visual-showcase/showcase-13-composite-analysis-dashboard.svg) | ![Heatmap](assets/visual-showcase/showcase-03-evidence-coverage-heatmap.svg) |
| **Volcano plot** | **Bar chart** |
| ![Volcano plot](assets/visual-showcase/showcase-11-volcano-candidate-screen.svg) | ![Bar chart](assets/visual-showcase/showcase-10-grouped-benchmark-bars.svg) |
| **Slopegraph** | **Radial chart** |
| ![Slopegraph](assets/visual-showcase/showcase-02-revision-lift-slopegraph.svg) | ![Radial chart](assets/visual-showcase/showcase-06-readiness-radial-scorecard.svg) |

More examples are available in [`assets/visual-showcase/`](assets/visual-showcase/).

## Keeping the writing natural

`ccf-paper-writer` can learn from exemplars chosen by the user. It studies how an effective paper frames its problem, unfolds its method, arranges evidence, and controls pace. It does not copy source sentences or turn one paper into a template for every field.

`ccf-humanization` removes habits that obscure the scholarship: defensive framing, repeated caveats, forced three-part lists, excessive em dashes, synonym cycling, and narration about internal version status. Facts that materially affect the claim, reproducibility, ethics, or venue requirements remain visible. Questions that require an authorial decision are raised separately rather than quietly inserted into the manuscript.

Review answers two different questions:

![Review and revision scoring](assets/ccfa-skills-review-boundaries.svg)

- **Is the current manuscript ready for its target venue?** This measures the remaining distance to the publication standard.
- **Did the revision make genuine progress?** This compares what the new version resolved and what new problems it may have introduced.

## Figures that remain editable

![Visual delivery](assets/ccfa-skills-artifacts.svg)

Quantitative figures begin with reproducible code and traceable data. Method, system, and architecture figures usually begin with GPT Image 2 exploring a visual language that suits the content. The user then chooses whether to continue toward editable SVG, vector PDF, or PPTX. Common concepts use a coherent open-source icon family, while method-specific icons are generated and cleaned separately. In PPTX, text, boxes, nodes, and connectors remain native objects wherever possible, so the final figure can still be meaningfully revised.

When a user does not want GPT Image 2 or explicitly prefers code-first drawing, `ccf-visual-composer` uses a pure-SVG route and labels it clearly.

## Distinct roles, shared story

![Skill collaboration boundaries](assets/ccfa-skills-routing.svg)

Clear responsibilities keep each judgment trustworthy:

| Your request | Responsible skill | What it deliberately avoids |
|---|---|---|
| Score and rank ideas | `ccf-idea-reviewer` | Does not turn a low-scoring idea into a full method during evaluation |
| Develop one rough idea | `ccf-idea-optimizer` | Does not make ranking its primary goal |
| Find benchmarks and published results | `ccf-literature-searcher` | Does not invent an experiment conclusion |
| Choose baselines, metrics, and ablations | `ccf-experiment-designer` | Does not alter or fabricate results |
| Read and digest one paper | `ccf-paper-reader` | Does not replace a complete paragraph-by-paragraph translation |
| Translate a complete paper with its original figures | `ccf-paper-translator` | Does not summarize, rewrite, or redraw the figures |
| Review, score, and diagnose | `ccf-paper-reviewer` | Does not rewrite the manuscript while judging it |
| Rewrite, polish, and compress | `ccf-paper-writer` | Does not conduct a new scientific review under the name of editing |
| Draw figures, tables, and PPTX | `ccf-visual-composer` | Does not choose datasets, metrics, or values |

Longer guidance lives in `references/`, while repeatable work belongs in `scripts/`. Iterative artifacts keep stable names so that a new version replaces the previous one instead of leaving behind a trail of indistinguishable attempts.

## Maintenance and validation

```powershell
python ccf-common\scripts\check_v04.py
python ccf-common\scripts\check_path_privacy.py
python ccf-common\scripts\check_markdown_links.py
python ccf-common\scripts\check_sources.py
```

These checks confirm that all 19 skills can be discovered, their responsibilities remain clear, documentation links resolve, and public files contain no machine-specific paths or private information. Experiment and efficiency results are summarized in [实验结果.md](实验结果.md).

## Commitments

- Never invent experimental results, citations, method components, or venue rules.
- Read only the private manuscript or unpublished material needed for the task.
- Use external retrieval and image generation with user authorization and minimal disclosure.
- Respect the user's decision to disable any skill.
- Explain the rubric, comparison target, evidence, and uncertainty behind every automated score.
